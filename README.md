## React dynamic list of TODOs

This project demonstrates my ability to handle dynamic lists and API integration using React.

# Key Features:

- Load and display todos from an API using TodoList component on app initialization.
- Implement a loader to indicate data fetching (handled with the provided Loader component).
- Open a modal (TodoModal) with the selected todo details upon clicking the "Show" button.
- Filter todos by completed status (all, completed, active) using a select input.
- Filter todos by title with a search input, with the option to clear the filter and reset the list.
- Proper error handling and modal behavior, including a close button.
- Smooth interaction while managing server requests and UI responsiveness.

# How to run:
